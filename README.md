Legal notes
-----------

- The project doesn't contain ***any*** original code from the game!
- To use this project you need to have an original copy of the game (bought from [Origin](https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-bad-company-2)), the project doesn't make piracy easier and doesn't break any of the DRM included in-game.

Build Requirements
------------------

- Visual Studio 2022

### Libraries:
- Boost
- detours
- OpenSSL v1.0.2 (with SSLv2/v3 support)

Compiling
---------

See [build workflow](https://github.com/GrzybDev/BFBC2_Hook/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yaml) for more detailed steps

1. Create `dependencies` folder in project root
2. Build requirements (specified in [Build Requirements](#build-requirements)) to `dependencies` folder in project root, each library has to be installed in its own folder (look at [libs](https://github.com/GrzybDev/BFBC2_Hook/tree/main/libs) folder structure for naming)
3. Build project in Visual Studio (It has to be x86 Release build, it's the only one configuration setup, but please check before doing that)

Installing
----------

Copy all `dll` files from either the latest build in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/GrzybDev/BFBC2_Hook/releases) or from `Release` folder if you compiled it yourself to the game root folder (where `exe` file is located)

Configuration
-------------

You can change the default behavior of the hook by creating JSON config named `config.json` in the game root folder

### Example configuration

This config will make game connect to locally hosted server, with final endpoint being `ws://localhost:8000/ws`

```
{
   "debug":{
      "logLevelConsole":1
   },
   "proxy":{
      "address":"localhost",
      "port":8000,
      "secure":false
   }
}
```
